## Welcome to Routstr

Routstr is a decentralized LLM (Large Language Model) routing marketplace that brings the convenience of centralized AI providers to the permissionless, censorship-resistant world of Nostr and Bitcoin. It enables seamless access to AI models through a unified interface while maintaining privacy, reducing costs, and eliminating traditional payment barriers.

## How Routstr Works

Routstr creates a decentralized marketplace where:

1. **AI Model Providers** can offer their inference services and receive micropayments without complex payment infrastructure
2. **End Users** can access a wide range of AI models through a single, unified API with automatic routing to the best available option

This approach combines the best of both worlds: the convenience of centralized services with the freedom and privacy of decentralized networks.

## Documentation Overview

This documentation is organized into two main sections:

## Current Status

Routstr is actively being developed according to the following roadmap:

1. **RIP-01**: OpenAI-API Proxy with Cashu micropayments for LLM inference
2. **RIP-02**: Nostr event announcements for inference nodes and capabilities
3. **RIP-03**: Web interface for browsing and filtering available nodes
4. **RIP-04 & RIP-05**: Anonymous evaluations and smart clients with Tor/proxy routing
