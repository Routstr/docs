# Development Guide

This guide covers how to set up and develop with Routstr, whether you're building an application that uses Routstr, or contributing to Routstr itself.

## Repository Structure

The Routstr project consists of several key components:

```
/routstr
  /proxy         - Self-hosted proxy for model providers
  /frontend      - Web interface for the Routstr marketplace
  /protocol      - Core protocol specifications (RIPs)
  /docs          - Documentation site
  /scripts       - Utility scripts and development tools
```

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 19 or higher
- Docker (for containerized development)
- A Lightning wallet or node (for payment testing)
- Cashu mint (optional, for token payments)

### Setting Up the Proxy

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/routstr/routstr.git
cd routstr/proxy

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the proxy
npm run build

# Run the proxy locally
npm run dev
```

### Setting Up the Frontend

```bash
cd routstr/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

## Running Tests

We use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing:

```bash
# Run proxy tests
cd proxy
npm test

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Working with the Protocol

The Routstr Improvement Proposals (RIPs) define the standards and protocols that make up the Routstr network:

- **RIP-01**: OpenAI-API Proxy with Cashu micropayments
- **RIP-02**: Nostr event announcements for inference nodes
- **RIP-03**: Web interface for browsing and filtering nodes
- **RIP-04**: Anonymous quality evaluations
- **RIP-05**: Smart clients with Tor/proxy routing

When developing for Routstr, refer to these specifications to ensure compatibility.

## Local Development Network

For local development, you can set up a complete Routstr network locally:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a local Nostr relay">
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 7000:7000 scsibug/nostr-rs-relay
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a local Cashu mint">
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3338:3338 cashubtc/cashu-fedibtc
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a local proxy">
    Create a config with the local relay and mint:
    
    ```json
    {
      "proxy": {
        "name": "Local Provider",
        "endpoint": "http://localhost:11434/v1"
      },
      "routing": {
        "nostr": {
          "relays": ["ws://localhost:7000"]
        }
      },
      "payment": {
        "cashu": {
          "enabled": true,
          "mint": "http://localhost:3338"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the proxy">
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/config.json:/app/config.json ghcr.io/routstr/proxy
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Docker Deployment

For production deployment, use the official Docker image:

```bash
# Pull the latest proxy image
docker pull ghcr.io/routstr/proxy:latest

# Run the proxy with your configuration
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/config.json:/app/config.json ghcr.io/routstr/proxy
```

## Contributing to Routstr

We welcome contributions to all aspects of the Routstr ecosystem:

1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. **Open a Pull Request**

### Coding Standards

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style and include tests
- Documentation is required for new features

## Building and Deploying

### Building the Proxy

```bash
cd proxy
npm run build
```

The built package will be in the `dist` directory.

### Building the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `out` directory.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Proxy connection issues">
    If the proxy cannot connect to providers:
    
    1. Check that your Nostr relays are accessible
    2. Verify that your proxy is properly announced to the network
    3. Ensure your local network allows the connections
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provider not receiving requests">
    If your provider isn't receiving requests:
    
    1. Verify it's properly announced to the network
    2. Check that your API endpoint is accessible
    3. Look at the proxy logs for errors
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payment problems">
    For payment issues:
    
    1. Test your Lightning or Cashu setup independently
    2. Verify the payment flow using the debugging tools
    3. Check logs for payment-related errors
  </Accordion>
