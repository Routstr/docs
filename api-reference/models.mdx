# Models API

The Models API allows you to discover and get information about the models available through Routstr's proxy to OpenRouter.ai.

## Base URL

```
https://api.routstr.com/v1/models
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication with your Cashu token.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CASHU_TOKEN
```

## Endpoints

### List Models

```http
GET /v1/models
```

Returns a list of models available through the Routstr platform.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.routstr.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CASHU_TOKEN"
```

#### Example Response

```json

      "id": "llama-3-70b-chat",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1714475790,
      "owned_by": "meta",
      "permission": [],
      "pricing": {
        "prompt": 0.0007,
        "completion": 0.0014
      },
      "context_length": 8192
    }
  ]
}
```

Since Routstr proxies to OpenRouter.ai, the available models depend on what OpenRouter.ai offers. The models listed above are examples and may not represent the current available models.

## Pricing

Each model has different pricing for input tokens (prompt) and output tokens (completion). The pricing is shown in dollars per 1,000 tokens. For example, GPT-4 costs $0.03 per 1,000 input tokens and $0.06 per 1,000 output tokens.
