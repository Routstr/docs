# Routstr API Reference

Welcome to the Routstr API documentation. Our API enables you to access AI models through a proxy service to OpenRouter.ai, with integrated wallet functionality for payments using Cashu tokens.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using bearer tokens. These tokens are Cashu tokens which contain pre-paid credits.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.routstr.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CASHU_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Hello"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## API Compatibility

<Note>
Our API is a 1:1 proxy to OpenRouter.ai, which itself is compatible with OpenAI's API format, making it easy to switch between providers.
</Note>

## API Endpoints

The Routstr API consists of several core endpoints:

### Core Endpoints

- **Proxy Endpoints** (`/{path}`): All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are supported for proxying requests to the underlying OpenRouter.ai API.

### Wallet Endpoints

- **Account Info** (`/v1/wallet/`): Get information about your account and remaining balance.
- **Topup Balance** (`/v1/wallet/topup`): Add funds to your account using Cashu tokens.
- **Refund Balance** (`/v1/wallet/refund`): Withdraw your remaining balance as a Cashu token.

## Example: Account Information

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.routstr.com/v1/wallet/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CASHU_TOKEN"
```

## Example: Adding Funds to Your Account

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.routstr.com/v1/wallet/topup?cashu_token=YOUR_NEW_CASHU_TOKEN \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_EXISTING_CASHU_TOKEN"
```
