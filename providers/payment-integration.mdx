# Payment Integration

This guide explains how to set up and manage payment methods for your Routstr provider node, allowing you to receive micropayments for your AI inference services.

## Supported Payment Methods

Routstr supports the following payment methods:

1. **Lightning Network**: Fast, low-fee Bitcoin payments
2. **Cashu Tokens**: Anonymous ecash tokens
3. **API Keys**: Prepaid credits for trusted users

## Lightning Network Integration

### Lightning Address Setup

The simplest way to receive Lightning payments is through a Lightning address:

```json
"payment": {
  "lightning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "address": "your@lightning.address",
    "minAmount": 10  // minimum payment in sats
  }
}
```

You can get a Lightning address from services like:
- [LightningTipBot](https://lightsats.com)
- [Wallet of Satoshi](https://walletofsatoshi.com)
- [Alby](https://getalby.com)
- [Zebedee](https://zebedee.io)

### LNbits Integration

For more control, you can use LNbits to handle Lightning payments:

```json
"payment": {
  "lightning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "lnbits",
    "lnbitsUrl": "https://legend.lnbits.com",
    "apiKey": "your-lnbits-admin-key",
    "invoiceExpiry": 300  // seconds
  }
}
```

### Lightning Node Integration

For advanced users, connect directly to your Lightning node:

#### LND

```json
"payment": {
  "lightning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "lnd",
    "lndRestUrl": "https://your-lnd-node:8080",
    "macaroon": "hex-encoded-admin-macaroon",
    "tlsCert": "base64-encoded-tls-cert"  // Optional
  }
}
```

#### Core Lightning (CLN)

```json
"payment": {
  "lightning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "cln",
    "clnRpcPath": "/path/to/lightning-rpc",
    "clnNodeDir": "/path/to/.lightning"
  }
}
```

## Cashu Integration

[Cashu](https://cashu.space) is an anonymous ecash system that allows for completely private payments.

### Basic Setup

```json
"payment": {
  "cashu": {
    "enabled": true,
    "minAmount": 5  // minimum token value in sats
  }
}
```

### Custom Mint

You can also run your own Cashu mint:

```json
"payment": {
  "cashu": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mint": "https://your-cashu-mint.com",
    "customMint": true,  // Only accept tokens from your mint
    "keys": {
      "keysets": ["mint-keyset-id"],
      "privateKeys": {
        "mint-keyset-id": "your-private-keys"  // Optional, for running your own mint
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Prepaid API Keys

For trusted users or organizations, you can create prepaid API keys:

```json
"payment": {
  "prepaid": {
    "enabled": true,
    "apiKeys": {
      "test-api-key": {
        "balance": 10000,  // sats
        "expiryDate": "2025-12-31",
        "name": "Test User",
        "email": "test@example.com"  // Optional
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Payment Webhooks

You can set up webhooks to be notified of payments:

```json
"payment": {
  "webhooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "url": "https://your-server.com/payment-webhook",
    "secret": "your-webhook-secret",
    "events": ["payment.received", "payment.failed", "token.redeemed"]
  }
}
```

## Payment Tracking

### Viewing Payment History

Monitor your payments with the provider CLI:

```bash
routstr-provider payments list
```

To view details of a specific payment:

```bash
routstr-provider payments show payment-id
```

### Payment Reports

Generate payment reports for accounting:

```bash
routstr-provider payments report --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-01-31
```

## Advanced Payment Settings

### Fee Management

Configure how fees are handled:

```json
"payment": {
  "fees": {
    "includeInPrice": true,  // Include Lightning fees in the price
    "maxFeePercent": 1.0,    // Maximum fee as percentage of payment
    "maxFeeAbsolute": 5      // Maximum fee in sats
  }
}
```

### Payment Batching

For improved efficiency with small payments:

```json
"payment": {
  "batching": {
    "enabled": true,
    "threshold": 1000,      // Batch payments below this amount
    "interval": 3600,       // Seconds between batch processing
    "minBatchSize": 10      // Minimum payments to batch
  }
}
```

## Multi-Currency Support

While Routstr primarily uses Bitcoin (sats), you can set display currencies:

```json
"payment": {
  "currencies": {
    "display": ["USD", "EUR"],
    "rates": {
      "provider": "coingecko",
      "cacheTime": 3600
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Secure your keys**: Store Lightning and Cashu keys securely
2. **Regular backups**: Back up payment data regularly
3. **Monitor activity**: Set up alerts for unusual payment patterns
4. **Implement rate limits**: Prevent payment-related DoS attacks
5. **Use HTTPS**: Secure your payment endpoints with proper TLS

## Troubleshooting
