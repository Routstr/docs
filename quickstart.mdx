## For Users: Quick Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a Cashu token">
    You can mint tokens in the settings of our web app at [chat.routstr.com](https://chat.routstr.com).
    Alternatively, generate a token using any Cashu wallet such as [cashu.me](https://cashu.me) or [minibits.cash](https://minibits.cash).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make API calls directly">
    Use your token in API calls with our OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.routstr.com/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <your Cashu token>" \
      -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "Hello"
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## For Providers: Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your proxy">
    Deploy our self-hosted proxy in front of any OpenAI-compatible endpoint with a simple Docker command:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/routstr/proxy
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect payments">
    Configure your Cashu mint or Lightning node using environment variables:

    ```bash
    # .env file example
    NSEC=your_nostr_secret_key
    RECEIVE_LN_ADDRESS=your@lightning.address
    ```

    Then run the proxy with:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/routstr/proxy
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and scale (coming soon)">
    Track usage, set custom pricing, and join the relay network to get discovered by users automatically:

    ```bash
    # Announce your provider to the Nostr network
    routstr announce --name "Your Provider" --models "gpt-4,llama-3"

    # Monitor usage statistics
    routstr stats
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
