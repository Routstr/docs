## For Users: Quick Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Buy Cashu tokens">
    Purchase AI credits directly with Lightning or on-chain Bitcoin:
    
    ```bash
    # Visit the Routstr token purchase page
    https://routstr.com/tokens
    ```
    
    No account or sign-up required. Simply make a Lightning payment to receive your token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive token instantly">
    After payment, you'll receive a Cashu token to use as your API authorization key:
    
    ```
    ROUTSTR_TOKEN=cashuA1DkpMbgQ9VkL6U...
    ```
    
    This token contains pre-paid credits for API usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make API calls directly">
    Use the token in your API calls with our OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.routstr.com/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer cashuA1DkpMbgQ9VkL6U..." \
      -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": "Hello"
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## For Providers: Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your proxy">
    Deploy our self-hosted proxy in front of any OpenAI-compatible endpoint with a simple Docker command:
    
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/routstr/proxy
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect payments">
    Configure your Cashu mint or Lightning node using environment variables:

    ```bash
    # .env file example
    NSEC=your_nostr_secret_key
    RECEIVE_LN_ADDRESS=your@lightning.address
    ```

    Then run the proxy with:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/routstr/proxy
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and scale">
    Track usage, set custom pricing, and join the relay network to get discovered by users automatically:
    
    ```bash
    # Announce your provider to the Nostr network
    routstr-proxy announce --name "Your Provider" --models "gpt-4,llama-3"
    
    # Monitor usage statistics
    routstr-proxy stats
    ```
  </Step>
