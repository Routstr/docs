# Privacy Features

Routstr is designed with privacy as a core principle. This guide explains the privacy features built into the platform and how to use them effectively.

## Privacy-First Architecture

Routstr's architecture is designed to minimize data collection and maximize user control:

1. **No User Accounts**: No email, phone number, or personal information required
2. **No Request Logging**: Your prompts and completions are not stored by Routstr
3. **Decentralized Network**: No central authority controls the entire system
4. **Private Payments**: Use Lightning Network or Cashu tokens for anonymous payments

## Privacy-Enhancing Technologies

### Tor Integration

Routstr includes built-in support for routing requests through the Tor network:

```bash
# Add Tor routing to your API requests
curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 -X POST https://api.routstr.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cashuA1DkpMbgQ9VkL6U..." \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Hello"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This prevents providers from seeing your real IP address and adds an additional layer of network privacy.

### SOCKS5 Proxy Support

For more flexibility, you can use any SOCKS5 proxy:

```bash
# Using a custom SOCKS5 proxy
curl --socks5-hostname your-proxy-server:1080 -X POST https://api.routstr.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cashuA1DkpMbgQ9VkL6U..." \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Hello"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Anonymous Payments

### Cashu Token Payments

[Cashu](https://cashu.space) is an anonymous ecash system that provides complete payment privacy:

1. Mint Cashu tokens using your wallet over the Lightning Network
2. No personal information is required to mint tokens
3. Tokens are bearer instruments - whoever has the token can use it
4. Spend tokens directly for API access without revealing identity

### Lightning Network Privacy

When using Lightning Network payments, you can enhance privacy by:

1. Using a privacy-focused Lightning wallet
2. Generating new payment codes for each transaction
3. Using a Lightning Address from a privacy-focused provider

## Best Practices for Privacy

1. **Use Tor or a trusted VPN/proxy** for all Routstr connections
2. **Pay with Cashu tokens** for maximum payment privacy
3. **Avoid including personal information** in prompts
4. **Use privacy-focused providers** when available
5. **Regularly rotate payment information** for improved privacy

## Self-Hosting for Maximum Privacy

For maximum privacy, you can:

1. **Self-host a Routstr proxy**: Run your own proxy to avoid third-party access
2. **Connect to trusted providers**: Choose providers with strong privacy policies
3. **Use your own Lightning node**: Process payments through your own node

```bash
# Run your own Routstr proxy
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/config.json:/app/config.json \
  ghcr.io/routstr/proxy
```

## Technical Privacy Protections

Routstr implements several technical privacy protections:

1. **End-to-end TLS**: All API connections use TLS encryption
2. **Token-based authentication**: No persistent user identifiers
3. **Minimal metadata**: Limited metadata collection in requests
4. **Circuit-breaking**: Prevent provider identity correlation
